## my first personal website
### well, first website ever

I made this simple vanilla js site in a couple hours when I was in my first semester of CS. Planning on making an updated site with React soon but for now this does the trick!

#### Original README text my 19 year old self chose (she was excited): 
Making a website for sh*ts n giggles (my very first one!).
